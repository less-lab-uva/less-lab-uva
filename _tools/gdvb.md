GDVB is a framework for generating benchmarks for DNN verification. GDVB leverages the idea of conbinatorial interaction testing in software engineering, as well as the combinations of the identified nine controlling factors that contributes to DNN verification performance. With a given seed DNN verification problem, it can generate a systematic and diverse benchmark that challenges DNN verification tools' capabilities in various aspects. Refer to the paper and the tool's website for more details.
