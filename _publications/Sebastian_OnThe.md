title: "On The Use Of Input/Output Queries For Code Search"
abstract: "Context: Programmers frequently compose keyword queries as they use information search engines to look for source code. This syntactic approach to code search is often imprecise and results in wasted efforts looking through irrelevant results. Semantic code search approaches aim to address this weakness by formulating queries that specify behavior, rather than keywords. A recent approach uses input/output examples as queries that illustrate the behavior of desired code. The technical feasibility of this approach has been …"
