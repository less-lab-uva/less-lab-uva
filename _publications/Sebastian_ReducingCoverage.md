title: "Reducing Coverage Collection Overhead With Disposable Instrumentation"
abstract: "Testers use coverage data for test suite quality assessment, stopping criteria definition, and effort allocation. However, as the complexity of products and testing processes increases, the cost of coverage data collection may grow significantly, jeopardizing its potential application. We present two techniques to mitigate this problem based on the concept of' disposable coverage instrumentation': coverage instrumentation that is removed after its usage. The idea is to reduce coverage collection overhead by removing instrumentation …"
