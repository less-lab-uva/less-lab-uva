title: "Syminfer: Inferring Program Invariants Using Symbolic States"
abstract: "We introduce a new technique for inferring program invariants that uses symbolic states generated by symbolic execution. Symbolic states, which consist of path conditions and constraints on local variables, are a compact description of sets of concrete program states and they can be used for both invariant inference and invariant verification. Our technique uses a counterexample-based algorithm that creates concrete states from symbolic states, infers candidate invariants from concrete states, and then verifies or refutes candidate …"
