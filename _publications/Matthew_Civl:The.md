title: "Civl: The Concurrency Intermediate Verification Language"
abstract: "There are many ways to express parallel programs: message-passing libraries (MPI) and multithreading/GPU language extensions such as OpenMP, Pthreads, and CUDA, are but a few. This multitude creates a serious challenge for developers of software verification tools: it takes enormous effort to develop such tools, but each development effort typically targets one small part of the concurrency landscape, with little sharing of techniques and code among efforts. To address this problem, we present CIVL: the Concurrency Intermediate …"
