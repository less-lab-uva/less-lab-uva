title: "Finding Feasible Counter-Examples When Model Checking Abstracted Java Programs"
abstract: "Despite recent advances in model checking and in adapting model checking techniques to software, the state explosion problem remains a major hurdle in applying model checking to software. Recent work in automated program abstraction has shown promise as a means of scaling model checking to larger systems. Most common abstraction techniques compute an upper approximation of the original program. Thus, when a specification is found true for the abstracted program, it is known to be true for the original program. Finding a specification to …"
