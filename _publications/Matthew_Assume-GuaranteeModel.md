title: "Assume-Guarantee Model Checking Of Software: A Comparative Case Study"
abstract: "A variety of assume-guarantee model checking approaches have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we describe several possible implementations of those approaches for checking properties of software components (units) using SPIN and SMV model checkers. Model checking software units requires, in general, the definition of an environment which establishes the run-time context in which the unit executes. We describe how implementations of such environments can be synthesized from specifications of …"
