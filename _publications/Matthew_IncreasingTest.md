title: "Increasing Test Granularity By Aggregating Unit Tests"
abstract: "Unit tests are focused, efficient, and there are many techniques to support their automatic generation. Coarser granularity tests, however, are necessary to validate the behavior of larger software components, and are also likely to be more robust in the presence of program changes. This paper investigates whether coarser granularity tests can be automatically generated by aggregating unit tests. We leverage our Differential Unit Test (DUT) framework to represent unit tests, define a space of potential aggregations of those …"
