title: "Transparent Debugging Of Dynamically Optimized Code"
abstract: "Debugging programs at the source level is essential in the software development cycle. With the growing importance of dynamic optimization, there is a clear need for debugging support in the presence of runtime code transformation. This paper presents a framework, called DeDoc, and lightweight techniques that allow debugging at the source level for programs that have been transformed by a trace-based binary dynamic optimizer. Our techniques provide full transparency and hide from the user the effect of dynamic optimizations on code …"
