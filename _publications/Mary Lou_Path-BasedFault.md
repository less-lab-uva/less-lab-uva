title: "Path-Based Fault Correlations"
abstract: "Although a number of automatic tools have been developed to detect faults, much of the diagnosis is still being done manually. To help with the diagnostic tasks, we formally introduce fault correlation, a causal relationship between faults. We statically determine correlations based on the expected dynamic behavior of a fault. If the occurrence of one fault causes another fault to occur, we say they are correlated. With the identification of the correlated faults, we can better understand fault behaviors and the risks of faults. If one fault …"
