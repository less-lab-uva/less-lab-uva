title: "Compositional Load Test Generation For Software Pipelines"
abstract: "Load tests validate whether a system's performance is acceptable under extreme conditions. Traditional load testing approaches are black-box, inducing load by increasing the size or rate of the input. Symbolic execution based load testing techniques complement traditional approaches by enabling the selection of precise input values. However, as the programs under analysis or their required inputs increase in size, the analyses required by these techniques either fail to scale up or sacrifice test effectiveness. We propose a new approach …"
