title: "Analyzing Interaction Orderings With Model Checking"
abstract: "Human-computer interaction (HCI) systems control an ongoing interaction between end-users and computer-based systems. For software-intensive systems, a graphic user interface (GUI) is often employed for enhanced usability. Traditional approaches to validation of GUI aspects in HCI systems involve prototyping and live-subject testing.
