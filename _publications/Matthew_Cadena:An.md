title: "Cadena: An Integrated Development, Analysis, And Verification Environment For Component-Based Systems"
abstract: "The use of component models such as Enterprise Java Beans and the CORBA Component Model (CCM) in application development is expanding rapidly. Even in real-time safety/mission-critical domains, component-based development is beginning to take hold as a mechanism for incorporating non-functional aspects such as real-time, quality-of-service, and distribution.
