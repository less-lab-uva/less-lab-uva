title: "Pre-Layout Clock Tree Estimation And Optimization Using Artificial Neural Network"
abstract: "Clock tree synthesis (CTS) takes place in a very late design stage, so most of the time, power consumption is analyzed while a circuit does not contain a clock tree. We build an artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the number of clock buffers and apply to each clock gater as well as clock source in ideal clock network. Clock structure is then constructed using such estimated clock buffers. Experiments with a few test circuits demonstrate very high accuracy of this method, average clock power estimation error less than 5%. The …"
