title: "A Language For Autonomous Vehicles Testing Oracles"
abstract: "Testing autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires complex oracles to determine if the AVs behavior conforms with specifications and humans' expectations. Available open source oracles are tightly embedded in the AV simulation software and are developed and implemented in an ad hoc way. We propose a domain specific language that enables defining oracles independent of the AV solutions and the simulator. A testing analyst can encode safety, liveness, timeliness and temporal properties in our language. To show the …"
