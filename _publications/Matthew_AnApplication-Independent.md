title: "An Application-Independent Concurrency Skeleton In Ada 95"
abstract: "Building high-quality concurrent software is a significant challenge. Issues such as performance, scalability, extensibility, and correctness, form a complex web of design decisions that software developers must navigate. In a number of well-understood software domains, reduction in the complexity of sequential software design has been enabled by the availability of collections of existing software components. Jn this paper, we present a component that provides similar benefits to developers of concurrent Ada 95 software that …"
