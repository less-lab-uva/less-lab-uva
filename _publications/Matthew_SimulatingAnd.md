title: "Simulating And Testing Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks"
abstract: "Developing applications for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can provide many challenges. Environmental conditions have a large impact on the behavior of an application, but it may not be feasible to replicate the conditions of the deployment environment while creating the application. Furthermore, long-term deployment of monitoring applications require extensive pre-deployment analysis of such applications since the sensors cannot be accessed after their deployment. Through a combination of simulation and software engineering practices …"
