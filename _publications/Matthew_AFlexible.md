title: "A Flexible Architecture For Building Data Flow Analyzers"
abstract: "Data flow analysis is a versatile technique that can be used to address a variety of analysis problems. Typically, data flow analyzers are hand-crafted to solve a particular analysis problem. The cost of constructing analyzers can be high and is a barrier to evaluating alternative analyzer designs. We describe an architecture that facilitates the rapid prototyping of data flow analyzers. With this architecture, a developer chooses from a collection of pre-existing components or, using high-level component generators, constructs …"
