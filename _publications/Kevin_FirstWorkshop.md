title: "First Workshop On The Economics Of Software And Computation"
abstract: "Software and the computational behaviors it defines are increasingly important sources of both economic costs and benefits for companies, governments and individuals. Nevertheless, our ability to reason about the economics of software and computation to improve decision-making remains primitive. The Workshop on the Economics of Software and Computation (ESC) provides a forum for research discussions in this area."
