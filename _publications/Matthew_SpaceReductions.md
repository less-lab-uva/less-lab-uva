title: "Space Reductions For Model Checking Quasi-Cyclic Systems"
abstract: "Despite significant research on state-space reductions, the poor scalability of model checking for reasoning about behavioral models of large, complex systems remains the chief obstacle to its broad acceptance. One strategy for making further progress is to exploit characteristics of classes of systems to develop domain-specific reductions. In this paper, we identify a structural property of system state-spaces, which we call quasi-cyclic structure, that can be leveraged to significantly reduce the space requirements of model checking. We give …"
