title: "Optimizing Monitoring Of Finite State Properties Through Monitor Compaction"
abstract: "Runtime monitoring has proven effective in detecting property violations, but it can incur high overhead when monitoring just a single property-particularly when the property relates multiple objects. In practice developers will likely monitor multiple properties in the same execution which will lead to even higher overhead."
