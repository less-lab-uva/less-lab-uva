title: "Eavesdropping On Fine-Grained User Activities Within Smartphone Apps Over Encrypted Network Traffic"
abstract: "Smartphone apps have changed the way we interact with online services, but highly specialized apps come at a cost to privacy. In this paper we will demonstrate that a passive eavesdropper is capable of identifying finegrained user activities within the wireless network traffic generated by apps. Despite the widespread use of fully encrypted communication, our technique, called NetScope, is based on the intuition that the highly specific implementation of each app leaves a fingerprint on its traffic behavior (eg, transfer rates, packet exchanges …"
