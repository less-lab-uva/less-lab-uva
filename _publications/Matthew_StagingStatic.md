title: "Staging Static Analyses Using Abstraction-Based Program Specialization"
abstract: "Conventional partial evaluators specialize programs with respect to concrete values, but programs can also be specialized with respect to abstractions of concrete values. We present a novel method for staging static analyses using abstraction-based program specialization (ABPS). Building on earlier work by Consel and Khoo and Jones, we give an ABPS system that serves as a formal foundation for a suite of analysis and verification tools that we are developing for Ada programs. Our tool set makes use of existing verification …"
