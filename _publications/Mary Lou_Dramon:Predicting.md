title: "Dramon: Predicting Memory Bandwidth Usage Of Multi-Threaded Programs With High Accuracy And Low Overhead"
abstract: "Memory bandwidth severely limits the scalability and performance of today's multi-core systems. Because of this limitation, many studies that focused on improving multi-core scalability rely on bandwidth usage predictions to achieve the best results. However, existing bandwidth prediction models have low accuracy, causing these studies to have inaccurate conclusions or perform sub-optimally. Most of these models make predictions based on the bandwidth usage samples of a few trial runs. Many factors that affect …"
