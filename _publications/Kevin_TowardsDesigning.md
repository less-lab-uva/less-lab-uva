title: "Towards Designing Effective Data Persistence Through Tradeoff Space Analysis"
abstract: "Partial system specifications give rise to design spaces: sets of designs that satisfy specified constraints but that can vary in other dimensions, including non-functional properties such as performance. A tradespace is a design space where each design is paired with its relevant corresponding properties. Exploring tradespaces to find high-value designs is hard and time-consuming. The software engineering field provides inadequate support for tradespace exploration. In the context of object relational mapping (ORM), modern model …"
