title: "Trace Normalization"
abstract: "Identifying truly distinct traces is crucial for the performance of many dynamic analysis activities. For example, given a set of traces associated with a program failure, identifying a subset of unique traces can reduce the debugging effort by producing a smaller set of candidate fault locations. The process of identifying unique traces, however, is subject to the presence of irrelevant variations in the sequence of trace events, which can make a trace appear unique when it is not. In this paper we present an approach to reduce …"
