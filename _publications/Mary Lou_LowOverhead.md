title: "Low Overhead Program Monitoring And Profiling"
abstract: "Program instrumentation, inserted either before or during execution, is rapidly becoming a necessary component of many systems. Instrumentation is commonly used to collect information for many diverse analysis applications, such as detecting program invariants, dynamic slicing and alias analysis, software security checking, and computer architecture modeling. Because instrumentation typically has a high run-time overhead, techniques are needed to mitigate the overheads. This paper describes' instrumentation optimizations' that …"
