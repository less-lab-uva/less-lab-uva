title: "Model-Based Fault Detection In Context-Aware Adaptive Applications"
abstract: "Applications running on mobile devices are heavily context-aware and adaptive, leading to new analysis and testing challenges as streams of context values drive these applications to undesired configurations that are not easily exposed by existing validation techniques. We address this challenge by employing a finite-state model of adaptive behavior to enable the detection of faults caused by (1) erroneous adaptation logic, and (2) asynchronous updating of context information, which leads to inconsistencies between the external physical context …"
