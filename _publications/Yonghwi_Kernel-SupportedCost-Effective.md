title: "Kernel-Supported Cost-Effective Audit Logging For Causality Tracking"
abstract: "The Linux Audit system is widely used as a causality tracking system in real-world deployments for problem diagnosis and forensic analysis. However, it has poor performance. We perform a comprehensive analysis on the Linux Audit system and find that it suffers from high runtime and storage overheads due to the large volume of redundant events. To address these shortcomings, we propose an in-kernel cache-based online log-reduction system to enable high-performance audit logging. It features a multi-layer caching …"
