title: "Exploiting Domain And Program Structure To Synthesize Efficient And Precise Data Flow Analyses (T)"
abstract: "A key challenge in implementing an efficient and precise data flow analysis is determining how to abstract the domain of values that a program variable can take on and how to update abstracted values to reflect program semantics. Such updates are performed by a transfer function and recent work by Thakur, Elder and Reps defined the bilateral algorithm for computing the most precise transfer function for a given abstract domain. In this paper, we identify and exploit the special case where abstract domains are comprised of disjoint …"
