title: "Code Churn: A Measure For Estimating The Impact Of Code Change"
abstract: "This study presents a methodology that will produce a viable fault surrogate. The focus of the effort is on the precise measurement of software development process and product outcomes. Tools and processes for the static measurement of the source code have been installed and made operational in a large embedded software system. Source code measurements have been gathered unobtrusively for each build in the software evolution process. The measurements are synthesized to obtain the fault surrogate. The complexity of …"
