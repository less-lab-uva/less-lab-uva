title: "Toward The Development Of Richer Properties For Recommender Systems"
abstract: "The performance of recommender systems is commonly characterized by metrics such as precision and recall. However, these metrics can only provide a coarse characterization of the system, as they offer limited intuition and insights on potential system anomalies, and may fail to provide a developer with an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of a recommendation algorithm. In this work, we start to describe a model of recommender systems that defines a space of properties. We begin exploring this space by defining …"
