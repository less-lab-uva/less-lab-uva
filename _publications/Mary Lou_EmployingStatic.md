title: "Employing Static Information In The Generation Of Test Cases"
abstract: "A commonly used approach for detecting defects in a program is to generate a suite of test inputs which exercises the entire program under a given testing criterion. Current techniques to generate test cases automatically that satisfy a testing criterion choose test input data by considering the testing requirements in an arbitrary order. In this paper, a technique is presented that groups the requirements and orders the generation of the test cases to reduce the number of test cases generated. The grouping is based on the statically …"
