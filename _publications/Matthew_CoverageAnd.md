title: "Coverage And Adequacy In Software Product Line Testing"
abstract: "Software product line modeling has received a great deal of attention for its potential in fostering reuse of software artifacts across development phases. Research on the testing phase, has focused on identifying the potential for reuse of test cases across product line instances. While this offers potential reductions in test development effort for a given product line instance, it does not focus on and leverage the fundamental abstraction that is inherent in software product lines-variability. In this paper, we illustrate how rich software product line …"
