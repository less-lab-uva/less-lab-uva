title: "Path Sensitive Analysis For Security Flaws"
abstract: "Despite increasing efforts in detecting and managing software security flaws, the number of security attacks is still rising every year. As software becomes more complex, security flaws are more easily introduced into a software system and more difficult to eliminate. In this talk, I present our research on the development of a framework for detecting and managing security flaws. The key idea is to develop static analysis tools to determine program paths that lead to various types of vulnerabilities. I describe a path-sensitive analysis that can …"
