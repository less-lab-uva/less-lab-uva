title: "Cadena: Enabling Ccm-Based Application Development In Eclipse"
abstract: "To support the trend toward component-based systems, the Cadena project aims to provide an Eclipse-based development environment that includes support for design, behavior modeling, formal reasoning, and automated code synthesis for systems built using the CORBA Component Model. In this paper, we describe the basic functionality of the Cadena tool, and summarize how it is currently being evaluated by industrial partners for use in developing high-assurance avionics applications."
