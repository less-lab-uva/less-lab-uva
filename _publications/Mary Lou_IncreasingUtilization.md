title: "Increasing Utilization In Modern Warehouse-Scale Computers Using Bubble-Up"
abstract: "Precisely predicting performance degradation due to colocating multiple executing applications on a single machine is critical for improving utilization in modern warehouse-scale computers (WSCs). Bubble-Up is the first mechanism for such precise prediction. As opposed to over-provisioning machines, Bubble-Up enables the safe colocation of multiple workloads on a single machine for Web service applications that have quality of service constraints, thus greatly improving machine utilization in modern WSCs."
