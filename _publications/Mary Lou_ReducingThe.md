title: "Reducing The Cost Of Data Flow Analysis By Congruence Partitioning"
abstract: "Data flow analysis expresses the solution of an information gathering problem as the fixed point of a system of monotone equations. This paper presents a technique to improve the performance of data flow analysis by systematically reducing the size of the equation system in any monotone data flow problem. Reductions result from partitioning the equations in the system according to congruence relations. We present a fast O (n log n) partitioning algorithm, where n is the size of the program, that exploits known algebraic properties in …"
