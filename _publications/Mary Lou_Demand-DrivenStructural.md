title: "Demand-Driven Structural Testing With Dynamic Instrumentation"
abstract: "Producing reliable and robust software has become one of the most important software development concerns. Testing is a process by which software quality can be assured through the collection of information. While testing can improve software reliability, current tools typically are inflexible and have high overheads, making it challenging to test large software projects. In this paper, we describe a new scalable and flexible framework for testing programs with a novel demand-driven approach based on execution paths to …"
