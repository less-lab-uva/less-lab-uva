title: "Empirically Driven Se Research: State Of The Art And Required Maturity"
abstract: "Software engineering researchers are increasingly relying on the empirical approach to advance the state of the art. The level of empirical rigor and evidence required to guide software engineering research, however, can vary drastically depending on many factors. In this session we identify some of these factors through a discussion of the state of the art in performing empirical studies in software engineering, and we show how we can utilize the notion of empirical maturity to set and adjust the empirical expectations for software …"
