title: "Una Based Iterative Test Data Generation And Its Evaluation"
abstract: "A number of approaches have been proposed to automatically generate test data to traverse a given path in a program. We present a program execution based approach to generate test data for a given path. The technique derives a desired input for a test path by iteratively refining an arbitrarily chosen input. A set of linear constraints on the increments to the input are derived to refine the input. We solve this constraint set using a Unified Numerical Approach (UNA) developed in this paper. Our technique can generate both integer and …"
