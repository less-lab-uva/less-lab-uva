title: "Detecting Problematic Message Sequences And Frequencies In Distributed Systems"
abstract: "Testing the components of a distributed system is challenging as it requires consideration of not just the state of a component, but also the sequence of messages it may receive from the rest of the system or the environment. Such messages may vary in type and content, and more particularly, in the frequency at which they are generated. All of these factors, in the right combination, may lead to faulty behavior.
