title: "Probabilistic Symbolic Execution"
abstract: "The continued development of efficient automated decision procedures has spurred the resurgence of research on symbolic execution over the past decade. Researchers have applied symbolic execution to a wide range of software analysis problems including: checking programs against contract specifications, inferring bounds on worst-case execution performance, and generating path-adequate test suites for widely used library code."
