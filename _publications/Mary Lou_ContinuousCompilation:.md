title: "Continuous Compilation: A New Approach To Aggressive And Adaptive Code Transformation"
abstract: "Over the past several decades, the compiler research community has developed a number of sophisticated and powerful algorithms for a variety of code improvements. While there are still promising directions for particular optimizations, research on new or improved optimizations is reaching the point of diminishing returns and new approaches are needed to achieve significant performance improvements beyond traditional optimizations. In this paper, we describe a new strategy based on a continuous compilation system that …"
