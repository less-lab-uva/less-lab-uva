title: "Understanding And Measuring The Sources Of Variation In The Prioritization Of Regression Test Suites"
abstract: "Test case prioritization techniques let testers order their test cases so that those with higher priority, according to some criterion, are executed earlier than those with lower priority. In previous work (1999, 2000), we examined a variety of prioritization techniques to determine their ability to improve the rate of fault detection of test suites. Our studies showed that the rate of fault detection of test suites could be significantly improved by using more powerful prioritization techniques. In addition, they indicated that rate of fault detection was closely …"
