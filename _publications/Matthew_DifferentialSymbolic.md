title: "Differential Symbolic Execution"
abstract: "Detecting and characterizing the effects of software changes is a fundamental component of software maintenance. Version differencing information can be used to perform version merging, infer change characteristics, produce program documentation, and guide program re-validation. Existing techniques for characterizing code changes, however, are imprecise leading to unnecessary maintenance efforts."
