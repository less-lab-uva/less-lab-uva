title: "A Case Study In Domain-Customized Model Checking For Real-Time Component Software"
abstract: "Despite a decade of intensive research on general techniques for reducing the complexity of model checking, scalability remains the chief obstacle to its widespread adoption. Past experience has shown that domain-specific information can often be leveraged to obtain state-space reductions that go beyond general purpose reductions by customizing existing model checker implementations or by building new model-checking engines dedicated to a particular domain. Unfortunately, these strategies limit the dissemination of model checking …"
