title: "Cpr: Cross Platform Binary Code Reuse Via Platform Independent Trace Program"
abstract: "The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) has been created a number of new platforms recently. Unfortunately, such variety of IoT devices causes platform fragmentation which makes software development on such devices challenging. In particular, existing programs cannot be simply reused on such devices as they rely on certain underlying hardware and software interfaces which we call platform dependencies. In this paper, we present CPR, a novel technique that synthesizes a platform independent program from a platform …"
