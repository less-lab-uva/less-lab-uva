title: "The Ultra Challenge: Software Systems Beyond Big"
abstract: "How can the ultra large systems (ULS) of the future be built if they will have the complexity of trillions of lines of code, maintain continuous 24x7 operations with no downtime, and live in a hostile environment with unpredictably changing requirements? This panel will discuss and debate the challenges posed by ultra large systems in terms of their design, growth, deployment and dynamics."
