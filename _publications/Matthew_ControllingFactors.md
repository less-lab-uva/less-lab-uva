title: "Controlling Factors In Evaluating Path-Sensitive Error Detection Techniques"
abstract: "Recent advances in static program analysis have made it possible to detect errors in applications that have been thoroughly tested and are in wide-spread use. The ability to find errors that have eluded traditional validation methods is due to the development and combination of sophisticated algorithmic techniques that are embedded in the implementations of analysis tools. Evaluating new analysis techniques is typically performed by running an analysis tool on a collection of subject programs, perhaps enabling and …"
