title: "An Empirical Study Of Tracing Techniques From A Failure Analysis Perspective"
abstract: "Tracing is a dynamic analysis technique to continuously capture events of interest on a running program. The occurrence of a statement, the invocation of a function, and the trigger of a signal are examples of traced events. Software engineers employ traces to accomplish various tasks, ranging from performance monitoring to failure analysis. Despite its capabilities, tracing can negatively impact the performance and general behavior of an application. In order to minimize that impact, traces are normally buffered and transferred to …"
