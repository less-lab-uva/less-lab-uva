title: "Limitations Of Emulating Realistic Network Environments For Correctness Testing Of Internet Applications"
abstract: "Realistic network environments are commonly emulated by Internet application developers to test both the performance and the correctness of their applications. In this paper, we argue that emulating just realistic network environments may be inadequate for detecting hard-to-detect faults that have very low occurrence probabilities but potentially high impact if exposed in the real world. Specifically, we conduct extensive experiments to study the correctness testing capabilities of realistic and unlikely network environments. Our results …"
