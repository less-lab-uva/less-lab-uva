title: "Catching And Identifying Bugs In Register Allocation"
abstract: "Although there are many register allocation algorithms that work well, it can be difficult to correctly implement these algorithms. As a result, it is common for bugs to remain in the register allocator, even after the compiler is released. The register allocator may run, but bugs can cause it to produce incorrect output code. The output program may even execute properly on some test data, but errors can remain. In this paper, we propose novel data flow analyses to statically check that the output code from the register allocator is correct in terms …"
