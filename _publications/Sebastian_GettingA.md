title: "Getting A Handle On The Fault Injection Process: Validation Of Measurement Tools"
abstract: "In any manufacturing environment, the fault injection rate might be considered one of the most meaningful criterion to evaluate the goodness of the development process. In our field, the estimates of such a rate are often oversimplified or misunderstood generating unrealistic expectations on their prediction power. The computation of fault injection rates in software development requires accurate and consistent measurement, which translates into demanding parallel efforts for the development organization. This paper presents the …"
