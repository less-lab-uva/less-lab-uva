title: "Load-Reuse Analysis: Design And Evaluation"
abstract: "Load-reuse analysis finds instructions that repeatedly access the same memory location. This location can be promoted to a register, eliminating redundant loads by reusing the results of prior memory accesses. This paper develops a load-reuse analysis and designs a method for evaluating its precision. In designing the analysis, we aspire for completeness---the goal of exposing all reuse that can be harvested by a subsequent program transformation. For register promotion, a suitable transformation is partial redundancy …"
