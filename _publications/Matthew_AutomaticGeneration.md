title: "Automatic Generation Of Load Tests"
abstract: "Load tests aim to validate whether system performance is acceptable under peak conditions. Existing test generation techniques induce load by increasing the size or rate of the input. Ignoring the particular input values, however, may lead to test suites that grossly mischaracterize a system's performance. To address this limitation we introduce a mixed symbolic execution based approach that is unique in how it 1) favors program paths associated with a performance measure of interest, 2) operates in an iterative-deepening …"
