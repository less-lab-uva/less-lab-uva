title: "A Framework For Exploring Optimization Properties"
abstract: "Important challenges for compiler optimization include determining what optimizations to apply, where to apply them and what is a good sequence in which to apply them. To address these challenges, an understanding of optimization properties is needed. We present a model-based framework, FOP, to determine how optimizations enable and disable one another. We combine the interaction and profitability properties to determine a' best' sequence for applying optimizations. FOP has three components:(1) a code model for the …"
