title: "Integrating Program Optimizations And Transformations With The Scheduling Of Instruction Level Parallelism"
abstract: "Code optimizations and restructuring transformations are typically applied before scheduling to improve the quality of generated code. However, in some cases, the optimizations and transformations do not lead to a better schedule or may even adversely affect the schedule. In particular, optimizations for redundancy elimination and restructuring transformations for increasing parallelism are often accompanied with an increase in register pressure. Therefore their application in situations where register pressure is already too high may …"
