title: "On Crop Height Estimation With Uavs"
abstract: "Remote sensing by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is changing the way agriculture operates by increasing the spatial-temporal resolution of data collection. Micro-UAVs have the potential to further improve and enrich the data collected by operating close to the crops, enabling the collection of higher spatio-temporal resolution data. In this paper, we present a UAV-mounted measurement system that utilizes a laser scanner to compute crop heights, a critical indicator of crop health. The system filters, transforms, and analyzes the cluttered …"
