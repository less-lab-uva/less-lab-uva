title: "A Demand-Driven Analyzer For Data Flow Testing At The Integration Level"
abstract: "Data-flow testing relies on static analysis for computing the definition-use pairs that serve as the test case requirements for a program. When testing large programs, the individual procedures are first tested in isolation during unit testing. Integration testing is performed to specifically test the procedure interfaces. The procedures in a program are integrated and tested in several steps. Since each integration step requires data-flow analysis to determine the new test requirements, the accumulated cost of repeatedly analyzing a program can …"
