title: "Model Checking Graphical User Interfaces Using Abstractions"
abstract: "Symbolic model checking techniques have been widely and successfully applied to statically analyze dynamic properties of hardware systems. Efforts to apply this same technology to the analysis of software systems has met with a number of obstacles, such as the existence of non-finite state-spaces. This paper investigates abstractions that make it possible to cost-effectively model check specifications of software for graphical user interface (GUI) systems. We identify useful abstractions for this domain and demonstrate that …"
