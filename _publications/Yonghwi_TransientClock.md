title: "Transient Clock Power Estimation Of Pre-Cts Netlist"
abstract: "Clock tree synthesis (CTS) is performed in a very late stage of design. Power estimation, therefore, can only be done without clock network in most design stages, which is not desirable given that clock network is usually the biggest power consumer. One may adopt an estimate of clock power, but its dynamic nature arising from clock gating brings a challenge in the estimation of clock power in a pre-CTS design. In this paper, we (1) estimate the clock tree components (clock gating cells (CGCs) and buffers as well as their …"
