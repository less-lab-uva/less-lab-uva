title: "Directly Characterizing Cross Core Interference Through Contention Synthesis"
abstract: "In this paper, we present a direct methodology and framework for the measurement and characterization of an application's cross-core interference sensitivity on multicore microarchitectures. While prior works use indirect indicators, such as last level cache miss rate, to infer an application's cross-core interference sensitivity, our approach is direct, in that it characterizes the application's cross-core interference sensitivity using the performance impact due to actual contention. Our methodology and framework, the Cross-core …"
