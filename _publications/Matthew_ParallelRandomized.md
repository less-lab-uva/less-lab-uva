title: "Parallel Randomized State-Space Search"
abstract: "Model checkers search the space of possible program behaviors to detect errors and to demonstrate their absence. Despite major advances in reduction and optimization techniques, state-space search can still become cost-prohibitive as program size and complexity increase. In this paper, we present a technique for dramatically improving the cost-effectiveness of state-space search techniques for error detection using parallelism. Our approach can be composed with all of the reduction and optimization techniques we are …"
