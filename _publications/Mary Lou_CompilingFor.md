title: "Compiling For Niceness: Mitigating Contention For Qos In Warehouse Scale Computers"
abstract: "As the class of datacenters recently coined as warehouse scale computers (WSCs) continues to leverage commodity multicore processors with increasing core counts, there is a growing need to consolidate various workloads on these machines to fully utilize their computation power. However, it is well known that when multiple applications are co-located on a multicore machine, contention for shared memory resources can cause severe cross-core performance interference. To ensure that the quality of service (QoS) of user-facing …"
