title: "Verifying Atomicity Specifications For Concurrent Object-Oriented Software Using Model-Checking"
abstract: "In recent work, Flanagan and Qadeer proposed atomicity declarations as a light-weight mechanism for specifying non-interference properties in concurrent programming languages such as Java, and they provided a type and effect system to verify atomicity properties. While verification of atomicity specifications via a static type system has several advantages (scalability, compositional checking), we show that verification via model-checking also has several advantages (fewer unchecked annotations, greater coverage of Java idioms …"
