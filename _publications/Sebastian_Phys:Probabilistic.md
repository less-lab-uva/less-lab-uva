title: "Phys: Probabilistic Physical Unit Assignment And Inconsistency Detection"
abstract: "Program variables used in robotic and cyber-physical systems often have implicit physical units that cannot be determined from their variable types. Inferring an abstract physical unit type for variables and checking their physical unit type consistency is of particular importance for validating the correctness of such systems. For instance, a variable with the unit of 'meter'should not be assigned to another variable with the unit of 'degree-per-second'. Existing solutions have various limitations such as requiring developers to annotate …"
