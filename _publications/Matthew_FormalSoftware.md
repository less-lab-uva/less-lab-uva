title: "Formal Software Analysis Emerging Trends In Software Model Checking"
abstract: "The study of methodologies and techniques to produce correct software has been active for four decades. During this period, researchers have developed and investigated a wide variety of approaches, but techniques based on mathematical modeling of program behavior have been a particular focus since they offer the promise of both finding errors and assuring important program properties. The past fifteen years have seen a marked and accelerating shift towards algorithmic formal reasoning about program behavior-we refer to these as …"
