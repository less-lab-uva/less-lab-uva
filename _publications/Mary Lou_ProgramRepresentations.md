title: "Program Representations For Testing Wireless Sensor Network Applications"
abstract: "Because of the growing complexity of wireless sensor network applications (WSNs), traditional software development tools are being developed that are specifically designed for their special characteristics. However, testing tools have yet to be proposed. One problem in developing testing tools is the need for a program representation that expresses the execution behavior. Due to characteristics of WSN applications that use a concurrent, event-based execution model, a representation is challenging to develop. In this paper, we present …"
