title: "Contention Aware Execution: Online Contention Detection And Response"
abstract: "Cross-core application interference due to contention for shared on-chip and off-chip resources pose a significant challenge to providing application level quality of service (QoS) guarantees on commodity multicore micro-architectures. Unexpected cross-core interference is especially problematic when considering latency-sensitive applications that are present in the web service data center application domains, such as web-search. The commonly used solution is to simply disallow the co-location of latency-sensitive …"
