title: "Using Component Metacontent To Support The Regression Testing Of Component-Based Software"
abstract: "Component based software technologies are viewed as essential for creating the software systems of the future. However, the use of externally-provided components has serious drawbacks for a wide range of software engineering activities, often because of a lack of information about the components. Previously (A. Orso et al., 2000), we proposed the use of component metacontents: additional data and methods provided with a component, to support software engineering tasks. The authors present two new metacontent based …"
