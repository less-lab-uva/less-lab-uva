title: "Verification Of Concurrent Software With Flavers"
abstract: "ABSTRACT In this demonstration we give a scenario of how FLAVERS, an implementation of the incremental accu- racy improving data flow analysis approach [I], is used to verify event sequence properties of concurrent or dis- tributed software programs. Keywords Data flow analysis, static analysis, verification, accuracy improving TECHNIQUE SUMMARY Incremental accuracy improving data flow analysis can be used to verify explicitly stated event sequence prop- erties of concurrent or distributed programs. With this approach, an analyst defines a set of program events of interest …"
