title: "A New Foundation For Control-Dependence And Slicing For Modern Program Structures"
abstract: "The notion of control dependence underlies many program analysis and transformation techniques. Despite wide applications, existing definitions and approaches for calculating control dependence are difficult to apply seamlessly to modern program structures. Such program structures make substantial use of exception processing and increasingly support reactive systems designed to run indefinitely. This paper revisits foundational issues surrounding control dependence and slicing. It develops definitions and algorithms for …"
