title: "Scheduling Dag'S For Asynchronous Multiprocessor Execution"
abstract: "A new approach is given for scheduling a sequential instruction stream for execution' in parallel' on asynchronous multiprocessors. The key idea in our approach is to exploit the fine grained parallelism present in the instruction stream. In this context, schedules are constructed by a careful balancing of execution and communication costs at the level of individual instructions, and their data dependencies. Three methods are used to evaluate our approach. First, several existing methods are extended to the fine grained situation. Our …"
