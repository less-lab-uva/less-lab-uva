title: "Civl: Formal Verification Of Parallel Programs"
abstract: "CIVL is a framework for static analysis and verification of concurrent programs. One of the main challenges to practical application of these techniques is the large number of ways to express concurrency: MPI, OpenMP, CUDA, and Pthreads, for example, are just a few of many' concurrency dialects' in wide use today. These dialects are constantly evolving and it is increasingly common to use several of them in a single' hybrid' program. CIVL addresses these problems by providing a concurrency intermediate verification language, CIVL-C, as …"
