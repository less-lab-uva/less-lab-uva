title: "Integrated Instruction Scheduling And Register Allocation Techniques"
abstract: "An algorithm for integrating instruction scheduling and register allocation must support mechanisms for detecting excessive register and functional unit demands and applying reductions for lessening these demands. The excessive demands for functional units can be detected by identifying the instructions that can execute in parallel, and can be reduced by scheduling some of these instructions sequentially. The excessive demands for registers can be detected on-the-fly while scheduling by maintaining register pressure values or may …"
