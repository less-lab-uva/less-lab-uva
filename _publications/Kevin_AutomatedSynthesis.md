title: "Automated Synthesis And Dynamic Analysis Of Tradeoff Spaces For Object-Relational Mapping"
abstract: "Producing software systems that achieve acceptable tradeoffs among multiple non-functional properties remains a significant engineering problem. We propose an approach to solving this problem that combines synthesis of spaces of design alternatives from logical specifications and dynamic analysis of each point in the resulting spaces. We hypothesize that this approach has potential to help engineers understand important tradeoffs among dynamically measurable properties of system components at meaningful scales within reach …"
