title: "Cascading Verification: An Integrated Method For Domain-Specific Model Checking"
abstract: "Model checking is an established method for verifying behavioral properties of system models. But model checkers tend to support low-level modeling languages that require intricate models to represent even the simplest systems. Modeling complexity arises in part from the need to encode domain knowledge at relatively low levels of abstraction."
