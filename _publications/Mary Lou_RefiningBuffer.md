title: "Refining Buffer Overflow Detection Via Demand-Driven Path-Sensitive Analysis"
abstract: "Although static analysis is an important technique for detecting buffer overflow before software deployment, current static tools rely on considerable human effort for annotating code to help analysis, or for diagnosing warnings, many of which are false positives. This paper presents an analysis technique that refines information about the paths that involve a potential buffer overflow to help in the diagnosis and debugging of vulnerabilities. Instead of only reporting a vulnerable buffer or statement in the program, which most tools do, our …"
