title: "Interprocedural Conditional Branch Elimination"
abstract: "The existence of statically detectable correlation among conditional branches enables their elimination, an optimization that has a number of benefits. This paper presents techniques to determine whether an interprocedural execution path leading to a conditional branch exists along which the branch outcome is known at compile time, and then to eliminate the branch along this path through code restructuring. The technique consists of a demand driven interprocedural analysis that determines whether a specific branch outcome is correlated …"
