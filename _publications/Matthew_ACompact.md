title: "A Compact Petri Net Representation For Concurrent Programs"
abstract: "Department of Computer Science University of Massachusetts, Amherst tDept. of Information & Computer Science University of California, Irvine This paper presents a compact Petri net representation that is efficient to construct for concurrent programs that use explicit tasking and rendezvous style communication. These Petri nets are based on task int eraction graphs and are called TIG-based Petri nets (TPN) s. They form a compact representation by summarizing the effects of large regions of a program and making useful information about …"
