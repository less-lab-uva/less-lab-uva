title: "Value Prediction In Vliw Machines"
abstract: "The performance of VLIW architectures is dependent on the capability of the compiler to detect and exploit instruction-level parallelism during instruction scheduling. To exploit the detected parallelism, instructions are reordered to reduce the length of the code schedule and minimize the cycle count for execution. Code reordering is limited by the dependencies among instructions arising from both control flow and data flow. In this paper, we present the design of a VLIW architecture that uses value prediction to remove data dependencies and …"
