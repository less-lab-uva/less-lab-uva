title: "Regression Testing Of Guis"
abstract: "Although graphical user interfaces (GUIs) constitute a large part of the software being developed today and are typically created using rapid prototyping, there are no effective regression testing techniques for GUIs. The needs of GUI regression testing differ from those of traditional software. When the structure of a GUI is modified, test cases from the original GUI are either reusable or unusable on the modified GUI. Since GUI test case generation is expensive, our goal is to make the unusable test cases usable. The idea of reusing these …"
