title: "Automated Test Data Generation Using An Iterative Relaxation Method"
abstract: "An important problem that arises in path oriented testing is the generation of test data that causes a program to follow a given path. In this paper, we present a novel program execution based approach using an iterative relaxation method to address the above problem. In this method, test data generation is initiated with an arbitrarily chosen input from a given domain. This input is then iteratively refined to obtain an input on which all the branch predicates on the given path evaluate to the desired outcome. In each iteration the …"
