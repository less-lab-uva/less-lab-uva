title: 'At the End of Synthesis: Narrowing Program Candidates'
abstract: Program synthesis is succeeding in supporting the generation of programs within increasingly complex domains. The use of weaker specifications, such as those consisting of input/output examples or test cases, has helped to fuel the success of program synthesis by lowering adoption barriers. Yet, employing weaker specifications has the side effect of generating a potentially large number of candidate programs. This was not a problem for simpler and smaller program domains, but it is becoming evident that differentiating among
