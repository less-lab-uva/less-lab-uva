title: "Sofya: Supporting Rapid Development Of Dynamic Program Analyses For Java"
abstract: "Dynamic analysis is an increasingly important means of supporting software validation and maintenance. To date, developers of dynamic analyses have used low-level instrumentation and debug interfaces to realize their analyses. Many dynamic analyses, however, share multiple common high-level requirements, eg, capture of program data state as well as events, and efficient and accurate event capture in the presence of threading. We present SOFYA-an infra-structure designed to provide high-level, efficient, concurrency-aw are …"
