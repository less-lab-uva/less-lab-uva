title: "Civl: Applying A General Concurrency Verification Framework To C/Pthreads Programs (Competition Contribution)"
abstract: "CIVL is a framework for the analysis and verification of concurrent programs. The front-end translates C programs that use (subsets of) Pthreads, MPI, OpenMP, or CUDA—alone or in combination—to an intermediate verification language CIVL-C. The back-end uses symbolic execution and model checking techniques to verify a number of safety properties of a CIVL-C program, such as absence of assertion violations, deadlocks, or out-of-bound indexes. We submit CIVL for verifying Pthreads programs in the concurrency category."
