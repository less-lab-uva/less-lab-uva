title: "In-Air Exchange Of Small Payloads Between Multirotor Aerial Systems"
abstract: "Exchanging payloads between multiple vehicles is a challenging problem that finds applications in sustained monitoring and long-range payload transportation. In this paper, we take the problem one step further and explore the design and implementation of a system of aerial vehicles that can exchange a small cargo/payload while air-borne. The proposed approach exploits the hover-capabilities of multirotor vehicles, and works within the constraints and the challenges imposed by such a task (such as proximity and contact …"
