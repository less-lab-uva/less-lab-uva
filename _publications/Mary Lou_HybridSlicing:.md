title: "Hybrid Slicing: An Approach For Refining Static Slices Using Dynamic Information"
abstract: "Program slicing is an effective technique for narrowing the focus of attention to the relevant parts of a program during the debugging process. However, imprecision is a problem in static slices since they are based on all executions that reach a given program point rather than the specific execution under which the program is being debugged. Dynamic slices are precise but require a large amount of run time overhead due to the tracing information that is collected during the program's execution. We present a general approach for improving the …"
