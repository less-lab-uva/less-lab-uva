title: "Debugging And Testing Optimizers Through Comparison Checking"
abstract: "We present a novel technique called comparison checking that helps optimizer writers debug optimizers by testing, for given inputs, that the semantics of a program are not changed by the application of optimizations. We have successfully applied comparison checking to a large class of program transformations that alter (1) the relative ordering in which values are computed by the intermediate code statements,(2) the form of the intermediate code statements, and (3) the control flow structure using code replication. We …"
