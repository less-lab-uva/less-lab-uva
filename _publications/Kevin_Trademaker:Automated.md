title: "Trademaker: Automated Dynamic Analysis Of Synthesized Tradespaces"
abstract: "System designers today are focusing less on point solutions for complex systems and more on design spaces, often with a focus on understanding tradeoffs among non-functional properties across such spaces. This shift places a premium on the efficient comparative evaluation of non-functional properties of designs in such spaces. While static analysis of designs will sometimes suffice, often one must run designs dynamically, under comparable loads, to determine properties and tradeoffs. Yet variant designs often present variant …"
