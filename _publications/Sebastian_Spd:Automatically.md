title: "Spd: Automatically Test Unmodified Network Programs With Symbolic Packet Dynamics"
abstract: "Network programs are difficult to test, especially under the large space of network program behavior defined by packet dynamics such as packet delay and packet loss. It is unlikely for common approaches using testbeds with random packet dynamics to cover the prohibitively large number of packet dynamics possibilities in a limited time. In this paper, we leverage symbolic execution to find the equivalence classes of packet dynamics which lead to exactly the same network program behavior, in order to efficiently check the large space of network …"
