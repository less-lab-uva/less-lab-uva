title: "Compile-Time Planning For Overhead Reduction In Software Dynamic Translators"
abstract: "Software dynamic translation (SDT) is a technology for modifying programs as they are running. The overhead of monitoring and modifying a running program's instructions is often substantial in SDT systems. As a result, SDT can be impractically slow, especially in SDT systems that do not or can not employ dynamic optimization to offset overhead. This is unfortunate since SDT has many advantages in modern computing environments and interesting uses of SDT continue to emerge. In this paper, we describe techniques to reduce …"
