title: "Influences On The Design Of Exception Handling Acm Sigsoft Project On The Impact Of Software Engineering Research On Programming Language Design"
abstract: "There has long been a close association between research in software engineering and the design of programming languages. Part of the IMPACT project involves an exploration of the interrelations of these two fields and documentation in a report of how fundamental research in software engineering has been a valuable resource for programming language features commonly used today. The resulting report investigates the relationship by considering features in currently used languages, including exceptions, control and data abstractions …"
