title: "Balancing Memory And Performance Through Selective Flushing Of Software Code Caches"
abstract: "Dynamic binary translators (DBTs) are becoming increasingly important because of their power and flexibility. However, the high memory demands of DBTs present an obstacle for all platforms, and especially embedded systems. The memory demand is typically controlled by placing a limit on cached translations and forcing the DBT to flush all translations upon reaching the limit. This solution manifests as a performance inefficiency because many flushed translations require retranslation. Ideally, translations should be selectively flushed …"
