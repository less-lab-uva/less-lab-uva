title: "Ursa: A Unified Resource Allocator For Registers And Functional Units In Vliw Architectures"
abstract: "The division of instruction scheduling and register allocation and assignment into separate phases can adversely affect the performance of these tasks and thus the quality of the code generated for load/store fine grained parallel architectures. Improved performance in one phase can deteriorate the performance of the other phase, possibly resulting in poorer overall performance. In this paper we present an approach that partitions instruction scheduling and register allocation and assignment into a new set of phases in an attempt to …"
