title: "Modularity Analysis Of Logical Design Models"
abstract: "Traditional design representations are inadequate for generalized reasoning about modularity in design and its technical and economic implications. We have developed an architectural modeling and analysis approach, and automated tool support, for improved reasoning in these terms. However, the complexity of constraint satisfaction limited the size of models that we could analyze. The contribution of this paper is a more scalable approach. We exploit the dominance relations in our models to guide a divide-and-conquer algorithm …"
