title: "Phriky-Units: A Lightweight, Annotation-Free Physical Unit Inconsistency Detection Tool"
abstract: "Systems that interact with the physical world use software that represents and manipulates physical quantities. To operate correctly, these systems must obey the rules of how quantities with physical units can be combined, compared, and manipulated. Incorrectly manipulating physical quantities can cause faults that go undetected by the type system, likely manifesting later as incorrect behavior. Existing approaches for inconsistency detection require code annotation, physical unit libraries, or specialized programming …"
