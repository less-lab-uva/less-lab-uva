title: "Using The Bandera Tool Set To Model-Check Properties Of Concurrent Java Software"
abstract: "Abstract The Bandera Tool Set is an integrated collection of program analysis, transformation, and visualization components designed to facilitate experimentation with model-checking Java source code. Bandera takes as input Java source code and a software requirement formalized in Bandera's temporal specification language, and it generates a program model and specification in the input language of one of several existing model-checking tools (including Spin [16], dSpin [6], SMV [3], and JPF [2]). Both program slicing …"
