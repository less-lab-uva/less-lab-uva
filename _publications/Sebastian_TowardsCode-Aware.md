title: "Towards Code-Aware Robotic Simulation: Vision Paper"
abstract: "This vision paper explores the potential to dramatically enrich robotic simulations with insights gleaned from program analysis, and promises to be a key tool for future robot system developers to reduce effort and find tricky corner cases. Robotic simulations are a critical, cost-effective tool for developing, testing, and validating robotic software. However, most robotics simulations are intentionally unaware of how the code works. Our approach leverages two recent developments: 1) automatic program analysis that can semantically …"
