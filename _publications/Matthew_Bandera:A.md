title: "Bandera: A Source-Level Interface For Model Checking Java Programs"
abstract: "Despite emerging tool support for assertion-checking and testing of object-oriented programs, providing convincing evidence of program correctness remains a difficult challenge. This is especially true for multi-threaded programs. Techniques for reasoning about finite-state systems have been developing rapidly over the past decade and have the potential to form the basis of powerful software validation technologies. We have developed the Bandera toolset to harness the power of existing model checking tools to apply them to …"
