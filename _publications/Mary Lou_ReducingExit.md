title: "Reducing Exit Stub Memory Consumption In Code Caches"
abstract: "The interest in translation-based virtual execution environments (VEEs) is growing with the recognition of their importance in a variety of applications. However, due to constrained memory and energy resources, developing a VEE for an embedded system presents a number of challenges. In this paper we focus on the VEE's memory overhead, and in particular, the code cache. Both code traces and exit stubs are stored in a code cache. Exit stubs keep track of the branches off a trace, and we show they consume up to 66.7% of the …"
