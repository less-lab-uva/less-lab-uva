title: "Generating Analyses For Detecting Faults In Path Segments"
abstract: "Although static bug detectors are extensively applied, there is a cost in using them. One challenge is that static analysis often reports a large number of false positives but little diagnostic information. Also, individual bug detectors need to be built in response to new types of faults, and tuning a static tool for precision and scalability is time-consuming. This paper presents a novel frame-work that automatically generates scalable, interprocedural, path-sensitive analyses to detect user-specified faults. The framework consists of a …"
