title: "Memory Optimization Of Dynamic Binary Translators For Embedded Systems"
abstract: "Dynamic binary translators (DBTs) are becoming increasingly important because of their power and flexibility. DBT-based services are valuable for all types of platforms. However, the high memory demands of DBTs present an obstacle for embedded systems. Most research on DBT design has a performance focus, which often drives up the DBT memory demand. In this article, we present a memory-oriented approach to DBT design. We consider the class of translation-based DBTs and their sources of memory demand; cached translated …"
