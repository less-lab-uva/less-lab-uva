title: "Reeact: A Customizable Virtual Execution Manager For Multicore Platforms"
abstract: "With the shift to many-core chip multiprocessors (CMPs), a critical issue is how to effectively coordinate and manage the execution of applications and hardware resources to overcome performance, power consumption, and reliability challenges stemming from hardware and application variations inherent in this new computing environment. Effective resource and application management on CMPs requires consideration of user/application/hardware-specific requirements and dynamic adaption of management decisions based on the actual …"
