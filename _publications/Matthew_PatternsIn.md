title: "Patterns In Property Specifications For Finite-State Verification"
abstract: "Despite the automation, users of finite-state verification tools still must be able to specify the system requirements in the specification language of the tool. This is more challenging than it might at first appear. For example, consider the following requirement for an elevator: Between the time an elevator is called at a floor and the time it opens its doors at that floor, the elevator can arrive at that floor'at most twice. To verify this property with a linear temporal logic (LTL) model checker, a developer would have to translate this informal requirement …"
