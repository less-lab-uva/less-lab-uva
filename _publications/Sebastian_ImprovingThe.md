title: "Improving The Cost-Effectiveness Of Symbolic Testing Techniques For Transport Protocol Implementations Under Packet Dynamics"
abstract: "1 INTRODUCTION he majority of Internet traic is transferred by transport protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), and Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP). Validating the implementation of such transport protocols is diicult because their behaviors depend not only on the protocol speciications but also on the network environment that can include diferent packet dynamics [41] such as packet delay, reordering, loss, and duplication. he prohibitively large number of …"
