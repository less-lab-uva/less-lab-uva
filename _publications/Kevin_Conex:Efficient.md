title: "Conex: Efficient Exploration Of Big-Data System Configurations For Better Performance"
abstract: "Configuration space complexity makes the big-data software systems hard to configure well. Consider Hadoop, with over nine hundred parameters, developers often just use the default configurations provided with Hadoop distributions. The opportunity costs in lost performance are significant. Popular learning-based approaches to auto-tune software does not scale well for big-data systems because of the high cost of collecting training data. We present a new method based on a combination of Evolutionary Markov Chain Monte Carlo (EMCMC) …"
