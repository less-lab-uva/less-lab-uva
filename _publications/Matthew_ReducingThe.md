title: "Reducing The Cost Of Path Property Monitoring Through Sampling"
abstract: "Run-time monitoring can provide important insights about a program's behavior and, for simple properties, it can be done efficiently. Monitoring properties describing sequences of program states and events, however, can result in significant run-time overhead. In this paper we present a novel approach to reducing the cost of run-time monitoring of path properties. Properties are composed to form a single integrated property that is then systematically decomposed into a set of properties that encode necessary conditions for …"
