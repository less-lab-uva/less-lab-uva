title: "Uas-Rx Interface For Mission Planning, Fire Tracking, Fire Ignition, And Real-Time Updating"
abstract: "This paper presents the development of an interface for small Unmanned Aerial Systems to allow the deployment of ignition spheres at a prescribed fire, real-time fire modeling, and user updates to the automated fire model. Current systems are limited to fire monitoring or modeling, generally rely on a desktop computer, and do not allow updates to the model nor parameter adjustments in the field. The novelty in the current approach is in enabling user control of all aspects of flight, including take-off, waypoint navigation, payload delivery, and …"
