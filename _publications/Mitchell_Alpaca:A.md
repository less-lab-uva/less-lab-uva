title: "Alpaca: A Large Portfolio-Based Alternating Conditional Analysis"
abstract: "Program analysis tools typically compute either may or must information. By accumulating both kinds of information computed with respect to different portions of a program's state space, it is possible to collect a comprehensive view of how program inputs relate to some property. This can be done using the framework of an alternating conditional analysis (ACA). In this paper, we present a toolset that instantiates an ACA to analyze C programs. The toolset, dubbed ALPACA (A Large Portfolio-based ACA), computes a sound characterization …"
