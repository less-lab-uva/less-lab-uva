title: "Gurrr: A Global Unified Resource Requirements Representation"
abstract: "When compiling for instruction level parallelism (ILP), the integration of the optimization phases can lead to an improvement in the quality of code generated. However, since several different representations of a program are used in the various phases, only a partial integration has been achieved to date. We present a program representation that combines resource requirements and availability information with control and data dependence information. The representation enables the integration of several optimizing phases …"
