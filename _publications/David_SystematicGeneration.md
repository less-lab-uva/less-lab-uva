title: "Systematic Generation Of Diverse Benchmarks For Dnn Verification"
abstract: "The field of verification has advanced due to the interplay of theoretical development and empirical evaluation. Benchmarks play an important role in this by supporting the assessment of the state-of-the-art and comparison of alternative verification approaches. Recent years have witnessed significant developments in the verification of deep neural networks, but diverse benchmarks representing the range of verification problems in this domain do not yet exist. This paper describes a neural network verification benchmark …"
