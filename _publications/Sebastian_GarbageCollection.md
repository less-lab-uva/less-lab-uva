title: "Garbage Collection In The Presence Of Remote Objects: An Empirical Study"
abstract: "Most virtual machine implementations employ generational garbage collection to manage dynamically allocated memory. Studies have shown that these generational schemes work efficiently in desktop-like applications where most objects are short-lived. The performance of generational collectors, however, has been rarely studied in the context of distributed systems. Given the increasing popularity of such systems, and the distinct type of objects they introduce to support the distributed paradigm, providing insights into their memory …"
