title: "Marple: Detecting Faults In Path Segments Using Automatically Generated Analyses"
abstract: "Generally, a fault is a property violation at a program point along some execution path. To obtain the path where a fault occurs, we can either run the program or manually identify the execution paths through code inspection. In both of the cases, only a very limited number of execution paths can be examined for a program. This article presents a static framework, Marple, that automatically detects path segments where a fault occurs at a whole program scale. An important contribution of the work is the design of a demand-driven analysis that …"
