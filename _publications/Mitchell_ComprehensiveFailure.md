title: "Comprehensive Failure Characterization"
abstract: "There is often more than one way to trigger a fault. Standard static and dynamic approaches focus on exhibiting a single witness for a failing execution. In this paper, we study the problem of computing a comprehensive characterization which safely bounds all failing program behavior while exhibiting a diversity of witnesses for those failures. This information can be used to facilitate software engineering tasks ranging from fault localization and repair to quantitative program analysis for reliability. Our approach combines the results of …"
