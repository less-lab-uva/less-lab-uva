title: "Interpreted Formalisms For Configurations"
abstract: "Imprecise and incomplete specification of system\textit configurations threatens safety, security, functionality, and other critical system properties and uselessly enlarges the configuration spaces to be searched by configuration engineers and auto-tuners. To address these problems, this paper introduces\textit interpreted formalisms based on real-world types for configurations. Configuration values are lifted to values of real-world types, which we formalize as\textit subset types in Coq. Values of these types are dependent …"
