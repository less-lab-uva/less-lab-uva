title: "Theme: A System For Testing By Hardware Monitoring Events"
abstract: "The overhead of test coverage analysis is dominated by monitoring the application, which is traditionally performed using instrumentation. However, instrumentation can prohibitively increase the time and especially the memory overhead of an application. As an alternative to instrumentation, we explore how recent hardware advances can be leveraged to improve the overheads of test coverage analysis. These hardware advances include hardware performance monitors and multicore technology."
