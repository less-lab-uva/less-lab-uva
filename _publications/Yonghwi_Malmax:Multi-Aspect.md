title: "Malmax: Multi-Aspect Execution For Automated Dynamic Web Server Malware Analysis"
abstract: "This paper presents MalMax, a novel system to detect server-side malware that routinely employ sophisticated polymorphic evasive runtime code generation techniques. When MalMax encounters an execution point that presents multiple possible execution paths (eg, via predicates and/or dynamic code), it explores these paths through counterfactual execution of code sandboxed within an isolated execution environment. Furthermore, a unique feature of MalMax is its cooperative isolated execution model in which unresolved …"
