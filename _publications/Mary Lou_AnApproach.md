title: "An Approach Toward Profit-Driven Optimization"
abstract: "Although optimizations have been applied for a number of years to improve the performance of software, problems with respect to the application of optimizations have not been adequately addressed. For example, in certain circumstances, optimizations may degrade performance. However, there is no efficient way to know when a degradation will occur. In this research, we investigate the profitability of optimizations, which is useful for determining the benefit of applying optimizations. We develop a framework that enables us to predict …"
