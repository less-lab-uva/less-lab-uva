title: "Softtest: A Framework For Software Testing Of Java Programs"
abstract: "Producing reliable and robust software has become one of the most important software development concerns in recent years. Testing is a process by which software quality can be assured through the collection of information about software. While testing can improve software reliability, current tools typically are inflexible and have high over-heads, making it challenging to test large software projects. In this paper, we describe a new scalable and flexible framework, called SoftTest, for testing Java programs with a novel path-based …"
