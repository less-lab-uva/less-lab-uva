title: "Testing Cloud Applications Under Cloud-Uncertainty Performance Effects"
abstract: "The paradigm shift of deploying applications to the cloud has introduced both opportunities and challenges. Although clouds use elasticity to scale resource usage at runtime to help meet an application's performance requirements, developers are still challenged by unpredictable performance, little control of execution environment, and differences among cloud service providers, all while being charged for their cloud usages. Application performance stability is particularly affected by multi-tenancy in which the hardware is …"
