title: "Pol: Specification-Driven Synthesis Of Architectural Code Frameworks For Platform-Based Applications"
abstract: "Developing applications that use complex platforms for functionalities such as authentication and messaging is hard. Model-driven engineering promises to help, but transformation systems are themselves hard to produce. We contribute a new approach using constraint-based synthesis of partial code frameworks that developers complete by hand without the need for hand-coded transformation systems. Rather, synthesis is driven by formal, partial specifications of target platforms and application architectures, and by design (code) …"
