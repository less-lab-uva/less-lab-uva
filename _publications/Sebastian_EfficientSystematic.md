title: "Efficient Systematic Testing Of Network Protocols With Temporal Uncertain Events"
abstract: "The correctness of network protocol implementations is difficult to test mainly because of the temporal uncertain nature of network events. In order to test the correctness of a network protocol implementation using network simulators, we need to systematically simulate the behavior of the network protocol under all possible cases of temporal uncertain events, which is very time consuming. The recently proposed Symbolic Execution based Interval Branching (SEIB) simulates a group of uncertain cases together in a single simulation …"
