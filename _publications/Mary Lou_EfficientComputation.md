title: "Efficient Computation Of Interprocedural Definition-Use Chains"
abstract: "The dependencies that exist among definitions and uses of variables in a program are required by many language-processing tools. This paper considers the computation of definition-use and use-definition chains that extend across procedure boundaries at call and return sites. Intraprocedural definition and use information is abstracted for each procedure and is used to construct an interprocedural flow graph. This intraprocedural data-flow information is then propagated throughout the program via the interprocedural flow graph to …"
