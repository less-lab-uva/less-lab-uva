title: "Architecture As An Independent Variable For Aspect-Oriented Application Descriptions"
abstract: "In previous work [1], we demonstrated the feasibility of formally treating architectural style as an independent variable. Given an application description and architectural style description in Alloy [3], we map them to software architecture description that refines the given application in conformance with the given style. This paper extends our earlier work to aspect-oriented structures. We describe an aspect-enabled application description style, a map taking application descriptions in this style to pipe-and-filter architectures, and A2A, a …"
