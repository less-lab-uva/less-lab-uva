title: "Feasible And Stressful Trajectory Generation For Mobile Robots"
abstract: "While executing nominal tests on mobile robots is required for their validation, such tests may overlook faults that arise under trajectories that accentuate certain aspects of the robot's behavior. Uncovering such stressful trajectories is challenging as the input space for these systems, as they move, is extremely large, and the relation between a planned trajectory and its potential to induce stress can be subtle. To address this challenge we propose a framework that 1) integrates kinematic and dynamic physical models of the robot into the …"
