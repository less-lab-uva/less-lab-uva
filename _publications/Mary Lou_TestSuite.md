title: "Test Suite Reduction And Prioritization With Call Trees"
abstract: "This paper presents a tool that (i) constructs tree-based models of a program's behavior during testing and (ii) employs these trees while reordering and reducing a test suite. Using either a dynamic call tree or a calling context tree, the test reduction component identifies a subset of the original tests that covers the same call tree paths. The prioritization technique reorders a test suite so that it covers the call tree paths more rapidly than the initial test ordering. In support of program and test suite understanding, the tool also visualizes the call …"
