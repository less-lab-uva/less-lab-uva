title: "Performance Analysis Of Thread Mappings With A Holistic View Of The Hardware Resources"
abstract: "With the shift to chip multiprocessors, managing shared resources has become a critical issue in realizing their full potential. Previous research has shown that thread mapping is a powerful tool for resource management. However, the difficulty of simultaneously managing multiple hardware resources and the varying nature of the workloads have impeded the efficiency of thread mapping algorithms. To overcome the difficulties of simultaneously managing multiple resources with thread mapping, the interaction between various …"
