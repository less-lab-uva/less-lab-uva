title: "Software Model Checking: The Bandera Approach"
abstract: "Abstract Model checking techniques have been an effective means for finding subtle defects in hardware designs and communication protocols. The increased use of concurrent software in embedded applications and the widespread adoption of Java with its built-in concurrency constructs have led researchers to attempt to adapt model-checking techniques to software. To date, this effort has been hindered by several obstacles including construction of correct tractable models from programs with enormous state spaces …"
