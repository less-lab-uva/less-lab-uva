title: "Checking Strong Specifications Using An Extensible Software Model Checking Framework"
abstract: "The use of assertions to express correctness properties of programs is growing in practice. Assertions provide a form of checkable redundancy that can be very effective in finding defects in programs and in guiding developers to the cause of a defect. A wide variety of assertion languages and associated validation techniques have been developed, but run-time monitoring is commonly thought to be the only practical solution. In this paper, we describe how specifications written in the Java Modeling Language (JML), a general …"
