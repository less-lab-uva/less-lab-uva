title: "Slicing And Partial Evaluation Of Corba Component Model Designs For Avionics System"
abstract: "The use of component models such as Enterprise Java Beans and the CORBA Component Model (CCM) in application development is expanding rapidly. Even in real-time safety-critical and mission-critical domains, component-based development is beginning to take hold as a mechanism for in-corporating non-functional aspects such as real-time, quality-of-service, and distribution."
