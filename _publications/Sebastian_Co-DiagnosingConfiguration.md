title: "Co-Diagnosing Configuration Failures In Co-Robotic Systems"
abstract: "Robotic systems often have complex configuration spaces that, when poorly set, can cause failures. In this work we take advantage of the close synergy between user and robot in co-robotic systems to better diagnose and overcome configuration failures. We leverage users' understanding of the system to mark failures they observe while the system is in operation. A marked failure indicates that the robot either “did not do something when it should have” or “did something when it should not have”. The failure marking is coupled with an automated …"
