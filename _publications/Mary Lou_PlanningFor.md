title: "Planning For Code Buffer Management In Distributed Virtual Execution Environments"
abstract: "Virtual execution environments have become increasingly useful in system implementation, with dynamic translation techniques being an important component for performance-critical systems. Many devices have exceptionally tight performance and memory constraints (eg, smart cards and sensors in distributed systems), which require effective resource management. One approach to manage code memory is to download code partitions on-demand from a server and to cache the partitions in the resource-constrained device (client) …"
