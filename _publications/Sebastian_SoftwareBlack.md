title: "Software Black Box: An Alternative Mechanism For Failure Analysis"
abstract: "Learning from software failures is an essential step towards the development of more reliable software systems and processes. However, as more intricate software systems are developed, determining the nature and causes of a software failure becomes a great challenge. Although many existing techniques can help in understanding the nature of the failure, they are limited in some of the following aspects. First, they work only within controlled environments. Second, they have a major impact on the target system behavior …"
