title: "A Formal Study Of Slicing For Multi-Threaded Programs With Jvm Concurrency Primitives"
abstract: "Previous work has shown that program slicing can be a useful step in model-checking software systems. We are interested in applying these techniques to construct models of multi-threaded Java programs. Past work does not address the concurrency primitives found in Java, nor does it provide the rigorous notions of slice correctness that are necessary for reasoning about programs with non-deterministic behaviour and potentially infinite computation traces. In this paper, we define the semantics of a simple multi-threaded …"
