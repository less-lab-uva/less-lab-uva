title: "Green: Reducing, Reusing And Recycling Constraints In Program Analysis"
abstract: "The analysis of constraints plays an important role in many aspects of software engineering, for example constraint satisfiability checking is central to symbolic execution. However, the norm is to recompute results in each analysis. We propose a different approach where every call to the solver is wrapped in a check to see if the result is not already available. While many tools use some form of results caching, the novelty of our approach is the persistence of results across runs, across programs being analyzed, across different analyses and even …"
