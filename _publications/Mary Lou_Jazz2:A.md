title: "Jazz2: A Flexible And Extensible Framework For Structural Testing In A Java Vm"
abstract: "This paper describes a framework for structural testing in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), called Jazz2. The framework provides instrumentation, memory management, control flow analysis, and callback handling services for structural tests, such as branch and node coverage. Additionally, it has a language for the specification of how and where to test. These facilities allow for the efficient implementation of demand-driven and static testing techniques. Jazz2 supports an extensible test library, where new tests can be easily added …"
