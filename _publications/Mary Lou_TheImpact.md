title: "The Impact Of Memory Subsystem Resource Sharing On Datacenter Applications"
abstract: "In this paper we study the impact of sharing memory resources on five Google datacenter applications: a web search engine, bigtable, content analyzer, image stitching, and protocol buffer. While prior work has found neither positive nor negative effects from cache sharing across the PARSEC benchmark suite, we find that across these datacenter applications, there is both a sizable benefit and a potential degradation from improperly sharing resources. In this paper, we first present a study of the importance of thread-to-core …"
