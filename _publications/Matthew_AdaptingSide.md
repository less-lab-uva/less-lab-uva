title: "Adapting Side Effects Analysis For Modular Program Model Checking"
abstract: "There is a widely held belief that whole program analysis is intractable for large complex software systems, and there can be little doubt that this is true for program analyses based on model checking. Model checking selected program components that comprise a cohesive unit, however, can be an effective way of uncovering subtle coding errors, especially for components of multi-threaded programs. In this setting, one of the chief problems is how to safely approximate the behavior of the rest of the application as it relates …"
