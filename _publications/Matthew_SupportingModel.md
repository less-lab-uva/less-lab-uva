title: "Supporting Model Checking Education Using Bogor/Eclipse"
abstract: "This paper describes our effort on developing educational materials on model checking to help foster the adoption of software model checking. We describe the course materials that provide an in-depth theoretical background of model checking algorithms, coupled with a tool support to apply them that is built around the Eclipse platform. The educational materials presented here have been used to teach graduate-level model checking courses in a number of North American and European institutions."
