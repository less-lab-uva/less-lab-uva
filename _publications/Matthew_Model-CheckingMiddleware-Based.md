title: "Model-Checking Middleware-Based Event-Driven Real-Time Embedded Software"
abstract: "Component frameworks such as the CORBA Component Model (CCM) and middleware services such as the CORBA Event Service are increasingly being used to build safety/mission-critical distributed real-time embedded (DRE) systems. In this paper, we present a novel model-checking infrastructure for checking global temporal properties of DRE systems built on top of a Real-Time CORBA Event Service using CCM architectures. We describe how (a) building support for OO structures and communication layers directly in …"
