title: "Reducing Irrelevant Trace Variations"
abstract: "Identifying truly distinct traces is crucial for the performance and practicality of many dynamic analysis activities. For example, given a trace pool resulting from program failures, identifying the set of distinct traces can reduce the debugging effort by more quickly producing a smaller set of candidate fault locations. The process of discriminating valuable traces, however, is subject to the presence of irrelevant variations in the trace constitution, ie, the sequence of events in a trace, that can make a trace appear unique when it is not …"
