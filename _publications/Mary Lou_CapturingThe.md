title: "Capturing The Effects Of Code Improving Transformations"
abstract: "Symbolic debugging of transformed code requires information about the impact of applying transformations on statement instances so that the appropriate values can be displayed to a user. We present a technique to automatically identify statement instance correspondences between untransformed and transformed code and generate mappings reflecting these correspondences as code improving transformations are applied. The mappings support classical optimizations as well as loop transformations. Establishing mappings requires …"
