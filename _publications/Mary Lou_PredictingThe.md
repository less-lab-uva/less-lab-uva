title: "Predicting The Impact Of Optimizations For Embedded Systems"
abstract: "When applying optimizations, a number of decisions are made using fixed strategies, such as always applying an optimization if it is applicable, applying optimizations in a fixed order and assuming a fixed configuration for optimizations such as tile size and loop unrolling factor. While it is widely recognized that these fixed strategies may not be the most appropriate for producing high quality code, especially for embedded systems, there are no general and automatic strategies that do otherwise. In this paper, we present a framework …"
