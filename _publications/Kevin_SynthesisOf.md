title: "Synthesis Of Logic Interpretations"
abstract: "Logic interpretations define the relationships between real-world entities and their logic representations. We introduce an explicit structure for documenting interpretations based on real-world types. As we have demonstrated previously, the benefits of using real-world types can be considerable, but the effort required might deter programmers. In this paper, we introduce a semi-automated mechanism that:(a) synthesizes candidate real-world types,(b) infers real-world type bindings for program variables, and (c) synthesizes candidate type …"
