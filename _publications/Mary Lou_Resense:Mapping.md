title: "Resense: Mapping Dynamic Workloads Of Colocated Multithreaded Applications Using Resource Sensitivity"
abstract: "To utilize the full potential of modern chip multiprocessors and obtain scalable performance improvements, it is critical to mitigate resource contention created by multithreaded workloads. In this article, we describe ReSense, the first runtime system that uses application characteristics to dynamically map multithreaded applications from dynamic workloads—workloads where multithreaded applications arrive, execute, and terminate continuously in unpredictable ways. ReSense mitigates contention for the shared resources …"
