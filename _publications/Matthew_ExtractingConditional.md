title: "Extracting Conditional Component Dependence For Distributed Robotic Systems"
abstract: "Modern robotics systems rely on distributed event-based frameworks to facilitate the assembly of software out of collections of reusable components. These frameworks express component dependencies in data that encode event publish-subscribe relations. This loosely coupled architecture makes it difficult for developers to understand the dependencies and to predict the impacts of a change to a component as the components grow in number and complexity. Moreover, this encoding of dependencies renders …"
