title: "Software Fault Isolation For Robust Compilation"
abstract: "Memory corruption vulnerabilities are endemic to unsafe languages, such as C, and they can even be found in safe languages that themselves are implemented in unsafe languages or linked with libraries implemented in unsafe languages. Robust compilation mitigates the threat of linking with memory-unsafe libraries. The source language is a C-like language, enriched with a notion of a component which encapsulates data and code, exposing functionality through well-defined interfaces. Robust compilation defines what security …"
