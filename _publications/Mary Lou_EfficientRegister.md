title: "Efficient Register Allocation Via Coloring Using Clique Separators"
abstract: "Although graph coloring is widely recognized as an effective technique for register allocation, memory demands can become quite high for large interference graphs that are needed in coloring. In this paper we present an algorithm that uses the notion of clique separators to improve the space overhead of coloring. The algorithm, based on a result by R. Tarjan regarding the colorability of graphs, partitions program code into code segments using clique separators. The interference graphs for the code partitions are constructed one …"
