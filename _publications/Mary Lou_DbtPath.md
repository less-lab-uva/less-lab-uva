title: "Dbt Path Selection For Holistic Memory Efficiency And Performance"
abstract: "Dynamic binary translators (DBTs) provide powerful platforms for building dynamic program monitoring and adaptation tools. DBTs, however, have high memory demands because they cache translated code and auxiliary code to a software code cache and must also maintain data structures to support the code cache. The high memory demands make it difficult for memory-constrained embedded systems to take advantage of DBT-based tools. Previous research on DBT memory management focused on the translated code and auxiliary code …"
