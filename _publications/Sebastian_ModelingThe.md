title: "Modeling The Cost-Benefits Tradeoffs For Regression Testing Techniques"
abstract: "Regression testing is an expensive activity that can account for a large proportion of the software maintenance budget. Because engineers add tests into test suites as software evolves, over time, increased test suite size makes revalidation of the software more expensive. Regression test selection, test suite reduction, and test case prioritization techniques can help with this, by reducing the number of regression tests that must be run and by helping testers meet testing objectives more quickly. These techniques, however can …"
