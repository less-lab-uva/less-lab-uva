title: "Exact And Approximate Probabilistic Symbolic Execution For Nondeterministic Programs"
abstract: "Probabilistic software analysis seeks to quantify the likelihood of reaching a target event under uncertain environments. Recent approaches compute probabilities of execution paths using symbolic execution, but do not support nondeterminism. Nondeterminism arises naturally when no suitable probabilistic model can capture a program behavior, eg, for multithreading or distributed systems."
