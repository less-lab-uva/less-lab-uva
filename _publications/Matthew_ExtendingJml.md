title: "Extending Jml For Modular Specification And Verification Of Multi-Threaded Programs"
abstract: "Abstract The Java Modeling Language (JML) is a formal specification language for Java that allows developers to specify rich software contracts for interfaces and classes, using pre-and postconditions and invariants. Although JML has been widely studied and has robust tool support based on a variety of automated verification technologies, it shares a problem with many similar object-oriented specification languages—it currently only deals with sequential programs. In this paper, we extend JML to allow for effective specification of multi-threaded …"
