title: "Lightweight Detection Of Physical Unit Inconsistencies Without Program Annotations"
abstract: "Systems interacting with the physical world operate on quantities measured with physical units. When unit operations in a program are inconsistent with the physical units' rules, those systems may suffer. Existing approaches to support unit consistency in programs can impose an unacceptable burden on developers. In this paper, we present a lightweight static analysis approach focused on physical unit inconsistency detection that requires no end-user program annotation, modification, or migration. It does so by capitalizing on existing …"
