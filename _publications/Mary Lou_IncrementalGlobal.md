title: "Incremental Global Reoptimization Of Programs"
abstract: "Although optimizing compilers have been quite successful in producing excellent code, two factors that limit their usefulness are the accompanying long compilation times and the lack of good symbolic debuggers for optimized code. One approach to attaining faster recompilations is to reduce the redundant analysis that is performed for optimization in response to edits, and in particulars, small maintenance changes, without affecting the quality of the generated code. Although modular programming with separate compilation …"
