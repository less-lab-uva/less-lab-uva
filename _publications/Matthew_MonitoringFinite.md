title: "Monitoring Finite State Properties: Algorithmic Approaches And Their Relative Strengths"
abstract: "Monitoring complex applications to detect violations from specified properties is a promising field that has seen the development of many novel techniques and tools in the last decade. In spite of this effort, limiting, understanding, and predicting the cost of monitoring has been a challenge. Existing techniques primarily target the overhead caused by the large number of monitor instances to be maintained and the large number of events generated by the program that are related to the property. However, other factors, in particular, the algorithm …"
