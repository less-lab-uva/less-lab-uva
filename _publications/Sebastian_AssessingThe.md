title: "Assessing The Type Annotation Burden"
abstract: "Type annotations provide a link between program variables and domain-specific types. When combined with a type system, these annotations can enable early fault detection. For type annotations to be cost-effective in practice, they need to be both accurate and affordable for developers. We lack, however, an understanding of how burdensome type annotation is for developers.
