title: "Managing Technical Debt In Software-Reliant Systems"
abstract: "Delivering increasingly complex software-reliant systems demands better ways to manage the long-term effects of short-term expedients. The technical debt metaphor is gaining significant traction in the agile development community as a way to understand and communicate such issues. The idea is that developers sometimes accept compromises in a system in one dimension (eg, modularity) to meet an urgent demand in some other dimension (eg, a deadline), and that such compromises incur a' debt': on which' interest' …"
