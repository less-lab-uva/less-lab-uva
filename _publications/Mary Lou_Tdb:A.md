title: "Tdb: A Source-Level Debugger For Dynamically Translated Programs"
abstract: "Debugging techniques have evolved over the years in response to changes in programming languages, implementation techniques, and user needs. A new type of implementation vehicle for software has emerged that, once again, requires new debugging techniques. Software dynamic translation (SDT) has received much attention due to compelling applications of the technology, including software security checking, binary translation, and dynamic optimization. Using SDT, program code changes dynamically, and thus, debugging …"
