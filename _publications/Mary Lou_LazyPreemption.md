title: "Lazy Preemption To Enable Path-Based Analysis Of Interrupt-Driven Code"
abstract: "One of the important factors in ensuring the correct functionality of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is the reliability of the software running on individual sensor nodes. Research has shown that path-sensitive static analysis is effective for bug detection and fault diagnosis; however, path-sensitive analysis is prohibitively expensive when applied to a WSN application due to the large state space caused by arbitrary interrupt preemptions. In this paper, we propose a new execution model called lazy preemption that reduces this state …"
