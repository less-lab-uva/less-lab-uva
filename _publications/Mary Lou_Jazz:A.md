title: "Jazz: A Tool For Demand-Driven Structural Testing"
abstract: "Software testing to produce reliable and robust software has become vitally important. Testing is a process by which quality can be assured through the collection of information about software. While testing can improve software quality, current tools typically are inflexible and have high overheads, making it a challenge to test large projects. We describe a new scalable and flexible tool, called Jazz, that uses a demand-driven structural testing approach. Jazz has a low overhead of only 17.6% for branch testing."
