title: "Marple: A Demand-Driven Path-Sensitive Buffer Overflow Detector"
abstract: "Despite increasing efforts in detecting and managing software security vulnerabilities, the number of security attacks is still rising every year. As software becomes more complex, security vulnerabilities are more easily introduced into a system and more difficult to eliminate. Even though buffer overflow detection has been studied for more than 20 years, it is still the most commonly exploited vulnerability. In this paper, we develop a static analyzer for detecting and helping diagnose buffer overflows with the key idea of categorizing …"
