title: "Real-World Types And Their Application"
abstract: "Software systems sense and affect real world objects and processes in order to realize important real-world systems. For these systems to function correctly, such software should obey constraints inherited from the real world. Typically, neither important characteristics of real-world entities nor the relationships between such entities and their machine-world representations are specified explicitly in code, and important opportunities for detecting errors due to mismatches are lost. To address this problem we introduce real-world types to …"
