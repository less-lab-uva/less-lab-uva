title: "Refining Data Flow Information Using Infeasible Paths"
abstract: "Experimental evidence indicates that large programs exhibit significant amount of branch correlation amenable to compile-time detection. Branch correlation gives rise to infeasible paths, which in turn make data flow information overly conservative. For example, def-use pairs that always span infeasible paths cannot be tested by any program input, preventing 100% def-use testing coverage. We present an algorithm for identifying infeasible program paths and a data flow analysis technique that improves the precision of traditional def-use …"
