title: "The Impact Of Software Evolution On Code Coverage Information"
abstract: "Many tools and techniques for addressing software maintenance problems rely on code coverage information. Often, this coverage information is gathered for a specific version of a software system, and then used to perform analyses on subsequent versions of that system without being recalculated. As a software system evolves, however, modifications to the software alter the software's behavior on particular inputs, and code coverage information gathered on earlier versions of a program may not accurately reflect the coverage that would …"
