title: "Monarch: Model-Based Development Of Software Architectures"
abstract: "In recent work we showed that it is possible to separate, and combine formal representations of, application properties and architectural styles, respectively. We do this by defining style-specific mappings from style-independent application models to architectural models in given styles. This paper shows that this separation of concerns supports a model-based development and tools approach to architectural-style-independent application modeling, and architecture synthesis with style as a separate design variable. In support of these …"
