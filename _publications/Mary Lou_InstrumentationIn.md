title: "Instrumentation In Software Dynamic Translators For Self-Managed Systems"
abstract: "Self-managed software requires monitoring and code changes to an executing program. One technology that enables such self management is software dynamic translation (SDT), which allows a program's execution to be intercepted and controlled by a separate software layer. SDT has been used to build many useful applications, including software security checkers that check for code vulnerabilities, dynamic code optimizers, and program introspection tools. While these systems use program instrumentation, the instrumentation is …"
