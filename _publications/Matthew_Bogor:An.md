title: "Bogor: An Extensible And Highly-Modular Software Model Checking Framework"
abstract: "Model checking is emerging as a popular technology for reasoning about behavioral properties of a wide variety of software artifacts including: requirements models, architectural descriptions, designs, implementations, and process models. The complexity of model checking is well-known, yet cost-effective analyses have been achieved by exploiting, for example, naturally occurring abstractions and semantic properties of a target software artifact. semantic properties of target software artifacts. Adapting a model checking tool to …"
