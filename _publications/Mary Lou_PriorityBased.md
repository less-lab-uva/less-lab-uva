title: "Priority Based Data Flow Testing"
abstract: "Software testing is an expensive component of software development and maintenance. For data flow testing, test cases must be found to test the def-use pairs in a program. Since some of the def-use pairs identified through static analysis may be infeasible, no amount of testing effort may result in exhaustive testing of a program. Therefore in practice a fixed amount of effort is spent in testing a program. We develop an approach for assigning priorities to def-use pairs, such that the def-use pairs with higher priorities can be expected to require less …"
