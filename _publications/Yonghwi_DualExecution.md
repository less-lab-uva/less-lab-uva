title: "Dual Execution For On The Fly Fine Grained Execution Comparison"
abstract: "Execution comparison has many applications in debugging, malware analysis, software feature identification, and intrusion detection. Existing comparison techniques have various limitations. Some can only compare at the system event level and require executions to take the same input. Some require storing instruction traces that are very space-consuming and have difficulty dealing with non-determinism. In this paper, we propose a novel dual execution technique that allows on-the-fly comparison at the instruction level. Only …"
