title: "The Design And Implementation Of Genesis"
abstract: "Although code optimizations are necessary to parallelize code, few guidelines exist for determining when and where to apply optimizations to produce the most efficient code. The order of applying optimizations can also have an impact on the efficiency of the final target code. However, determining the appropriate optimizations is difficult due to the complex interactions among the optimizations, scheduler and architecture. To aid in selecting appropriate optimizations, an optimizer generator (Genesis) is presented that produces an …"
