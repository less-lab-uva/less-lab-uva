title: "Architectural Style As An Independent Variable"
abstract: "ABSTRACT A key idea in modern software engineering is that we can and should make architectural style choices separately from choices about many other system properties. There is a fundamental separation of concerns implicit in this idea: given an application model that expresses system properties independently of architectural style, we can choose a compatible architectural style and then map the application model to one or more architectural models (architectures) in this style.
