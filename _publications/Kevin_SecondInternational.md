title: "Second International Workshop On Ultra-Large-Scale Software-Intensive Systems (Ulssis 2008)"
abstract: "Software-intensive systems now being envisioned and in some cases developed will surpass complexity thresholds beyond which established software engineering concepts, methods and tools no longer work well. ULSSIS provides a forum in which researchers from industry, academia and governments come together to understand these issues and to discuss research and development activities to address them."
