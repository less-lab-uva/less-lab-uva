title: "Data Flow Analysis Driven Dynamic Data Partitioning"
abstract: "The use of distributed memory architectures as an effective approach to parallel computing brings with it a more complex program development process. Finding a partitioning of program code and data that supports sufficient parallelism without incurring prohibitive communication costs is a challenging and critical step in the development of programs for distributed memory systems. Automatic data distribution techniques have the goal of placing the responsibility of determining a suitable data partitioning into the domain of the compiler …"
