title: "Effective Source-Level Debugging Of Wireless Sensor Networks"
abstract: "Sensor network debugging is notoriously difficult because many bugs manifest themselves only when they encounter the real world--exactly when most powerful debugging tools can no longer be applied. There are currectly two common approaches to source level debugging in wireless sensor networks (WSNs),(i) simulation-based debugging [3], and (ii) wire-based debugging via logic analyzers or in-circuit emulators [1]. The former do not capture the true dynamics of a real deployment while the latter do not scale with the number …"
