title: "Adaptive Online Program Analysis"
abstract: "Analyzing a program run can provide important insights about its correctness. Dynamic analysis of complex correctness properties, however, usually results in significant run-time overhead and, consequently, it is rarely used in practice. In this paper, we present an approach for exploiting properties of stateful program specifications to reduce the cost of their dynamic analysis. With our approach, analysis results are guaranteed to be identical to those of a traditional expensive dynamic analyses, while analysis cost is very low-between …"
