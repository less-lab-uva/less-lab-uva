title: "Bubble-Up: Increasing Utilization In Modern Warehouse Scale Computers Via Sensible Co-Locations"
abstract: "As much of the world's computing continues to move into the cloud, the overprovisioning of computing resources to ensure the performance isolation of latency-sensitive tasks, such as web search, in modern datacenters is a major contributor to low machine utilization. Being unable to accurately predict performance degradation due to contention for shared resources on multicore systems has led to the heavy handed approach of simply disallowing the co-location of high-priority, latency-sensitive tasks with other tasks. Performing this …"
