title: "Fulldoc: A Full Reporting Debugger For Optimized Code"
abstract: "As compilers increasingly rely on optimizations to achieve high performance, the effectiveness of source level debuggers for optimized code continues to falter. Even if values of source variables are computed in the execution of the optimized code, source level debuggers of optimized code are unable to always report the expected values of source variables at breakpoints. In this paper, we present FULLDOC, a debugger that can report all of the expected values of source variables that are computed in the optimized code …"
