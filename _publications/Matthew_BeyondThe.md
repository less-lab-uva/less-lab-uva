title: "Beyond The Rainbow: Self-Adaptive Failure Avoidance In Configurable Systems"
abstract: "Self-adaptive software systems monitor their state and then adapt when certain conditions are met, guided by a global utility function. In prior work we developed algorithms and conducted a post-hoc analysis demonstrating the possibility of adapting to software failures by judiciously changing configurations. In this paper we present the REFRACT framework that realizes this idea in practice by building on the self-adaptive Rainbow architecture. REFRACT extends Rainbow with new components and algorithms targeting failure …"
