title: "Bda: Practical Dependence Analysis For Binary Executables By Unbiased Whole-Program Path Sampling And Per-Path Abstract Interpretation"
abstract: "Binary program dependence analysis determines dependence between instructions and hence is important for many applications that have to deal with executables without any symbol information. A key challenge is to identify if multiple memory read/write instructions access the same memory location. The state-of-the-art solution is the value set analysis (VSA) that uses abstract interpretation to determine the set of addresses that are possibly accessed by memory instructions. However, VSA is conservative and hence leads to a large …"
