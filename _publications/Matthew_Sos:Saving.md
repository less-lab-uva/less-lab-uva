title: "Sos: Saving Time In Dynamic Race Detection With Stationary Analysis"
abstract: "Data races are subtle and difficult to detect errors that arise during concurrent program execution. Traditional testing techniques fail to find these errors, but recent research has shown that targeted dynamic analysis techniques can be developed to precisely detect races (ie, no false race reports are generated) that occur during program execution. Unfortunately, precise race detection is still too expensive to be used in practice. State-of-the-art techniques still slow down program execution by a factor of eight or more. In this paper …"
