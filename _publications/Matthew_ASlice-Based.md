title: "A Slice-Based Decision Procedure For Type-Based Partial Orders"
abstract: "Automated software verification and path-sensitive program analysis require the ability to distinguish executable program paths from those that are infeasible. To achieve this, program paths are encoded symbolically as a conjunction of constraints and submitted to an SMT solver; satisfiable path constraints are then analyzed further. In this paper, we study type-related constraints that arise in path-sensitive analysis of object-oriented programs with forms of multiple inheritance. The dynamic type of a value is critical in determining program …"
