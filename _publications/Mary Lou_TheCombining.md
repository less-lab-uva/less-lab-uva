title: "The Combining Dag: A Technique For Parallel Data Flow Analysis"
abstract: "As the number of available multiprocessors increases, so does the importance of providing software support for these systems, including parallel compilers. Data flow analysis, an important component of software tools, may be computed many times during the compilation of a program, especially when compiling for a multiprocessor. Although converting a sequential data flow algorithm to a parallel algorithm can present some opportunities for computing data flow in parallel, more parallelism can be exposed by the development of …"
