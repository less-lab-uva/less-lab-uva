title: "Exploiting Partial Success In Applying Automated Formal Methods"
abstract: "The past decades have produced a wide-range of formal techniques for developing and assessing the correctness of software systems. Techniques, such as various forms of static analysis, automated verification, and test generation, can provide valuable information about how a system satisfies its specified correctness properties. In practice, when applied to large modern software systems all existing automated formal methods come up short. They might produce false error reports, exhaust available human or computational resources, or be …"
