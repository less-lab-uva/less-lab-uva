title: "Comparison Checking: An Approach To Avoid Debugging Of Optimized Code"
abstract: "We present a novel approach to avoid the debugging of optimized code through comparison checking. In the technique presented, both the unoptimized and optimized versions of an application program are executed, and computed values are compared to ensure the behaviors of the two versions are the same under the given input. If the values are different, the comparison checker displays where in the application program the differences occurred and what optimizations were involved. The user can utilize this information and a …"
