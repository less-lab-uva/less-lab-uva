title: "Reqos: Reactive Static/Dynamic Compilation For Qos In Warehouse Scale Computers"
abstract: "As multicore processors with expanding core counts continue to dominate the server market, the overall utilization of the class of datacenters known as warehouse scale computers (WSCs) depends heavily on colocation of multiple workloads on each server to take advantage of the computational power provided by modern processors. However, many of the applications running in WSCs, such as websearch, are user-facing and have quality of service (QoS) requirements. When multiple applications are co-located on a multicore …"
