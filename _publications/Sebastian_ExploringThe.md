title: "Exploring The Use Of Crowdsourcing To Support Empirical Studies In Software Engineering"
abstract: "The power and the generality of the findings obtained through empirical studies are bounded by the number and type of participating subjects. In software engineering, obtaining a large number of adequate subjects to evaluate a technique or tool is often a major challenge. In this work we explore the use of crowdsourcing as a mechanism to address that challenge by assisting in subject recruitment. More specifically, through this work we show how we adapted a study to be performed under an infrastructure that not only …"
