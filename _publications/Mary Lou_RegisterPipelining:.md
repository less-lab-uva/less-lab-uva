title: "Register Pipelining: An Integrated Approach To Register Allocation For Scalar And Subscripted Variables"
abstract: "Conventional compilers typically ignore the potential benefits of keeping array elements in registers for reuse, due in part to the fact that standard data flow analysis techniques used in register allocation are not expressive enough to distinguish among individual array elements. This paper introduces the concept of register pipelining as an integrated approach to register allocation for both scalar and subscripted variables. A register pipeline is a set of registers that is allocated to the live ranges of array elements inside a loop. By preserving …"
