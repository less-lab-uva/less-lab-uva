title: "A Practical Data Flow Framework For Array Reference Analysis And Its Use In Optimizations"
abstract: "Data flow analysis techniques have traditionally been restricted to the analysis of scalar variables. This retriction, however, imposes a limitation on the kinds of optimizations that can be performed in loops containing array references. We present a data flow framework for array reference analysis that provides the information needed in various optimizations targeted at sequential or fine-grained parallel architectures. The framework extends the traditional scalar framework by incorporating iteration distance values into the analysis to …"
