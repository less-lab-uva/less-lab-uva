title: "Response Time Analysis Of Hierarchical Scheduling: The Synchronized Deferrable Servers Approach"
abstract: "Hierarchical scheduling allows reservation of processor bandwidth and the use of different schedulers for different applications on a single platform. We propose a hierarchical scheduling interface called synchronized deferrable servers that can reserve different processor bandwidth on each core, and can combine global and partitioned scheduling on a multicore platform. Significant challenges will arise in the response time analysis of a task set if the tasks are globally scheduled on a multiprocessor platform and the processor …"
