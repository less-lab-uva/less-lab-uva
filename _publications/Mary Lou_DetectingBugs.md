title: "Detecting Bugs In Register Allocation"
abstract: "Although register allocation is critical for performance, the implementation of register allocation algorithms is difficult, due to the complexity of the algorithms and target machine architectures. It is particularly difficult to detect register allocation errors if the output code runs to completion, as bugs in the register allocator can cause the compiler to produce incorrect output code. The output code may even execute properly on some test data, but errors can remain. In this article, we propose novel data flow analyses to statically check that …"
