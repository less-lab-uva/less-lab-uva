Developing software for robot systems is challenging as they must sense, actuate, and represent the physical world. Sensing the physical world is usually noisy, actuating in and on the world is often inaccurate, and the knowledge and representation of the world is incomplete and uncertain. In this class we explore software engineering approaches to cope with those challenges. You will learn to use domain-specific abstractions, architectures, libraries, and validation approaches and tools to safely perform robot activities like motion, navigation, perception, planning, and interaction. The expectation is that this course will open up new career options in robotics for our students.
