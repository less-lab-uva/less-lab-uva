Testing mobile robots is difficult and expensive, and many faults  go undetected. In this work we explore whether fuzzing, an automated test input generation technique, can more quickly find failure inducing inputs in mobile robots. We developed a simple  fuzzing adaptation, Base-Fuzz, and one specialized for fuzzing  mobile robots, Phys-Fuzz. Phys-Fuzz is unique in that it accounts for physical attributes such as the robot dimensions, estimated trajectories,  and  time-to-impact  measures to guide the test input generation process. The results of  Phys-Fuzz evaluation suggest  that  it  has  the  potential  to  speed up the  discovery  of  input scenarios that reveal failures, finding 57% more than uniform random input selection.  ### MISSING: sentence from Trey describing figures below ###
