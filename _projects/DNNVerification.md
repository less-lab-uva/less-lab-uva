DNNV is a framework for verifying deep neural networks (DNN). 
DNN verification takes in a neural network, and a property over that network, and checks whether the property is true, or false. 
DNNV standardizes the network and property input formats to enable multiple verification tools to run on a single network and property. 
This facilitates both verifier comparison, and artifact re-use.
A video demonstration of our tool is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5G_OWfCF2o).
